# Abstract.
# abstract = "The KOTO experiment recently presented a significant excess of events in their search for the rare SM process KL->pivv, well above both Standard Model signal and background predictions. We show that this excess may be due to weakly-coupled scalars that are produced from Kaon decays and escape KOTO undetected. We study two concrete realizations, the minimal Higgs portal and a hadrophilic scalar model, and demonstrate that they can explain the observed events while satisfying bounds from other flavor and beam-dump experiments.  Hadronic beam-dump experiments provide particularly interesting constraints on these types of models, and we discuss in detail the normally underestimated uncertainties associated with them. The simplicity of the models which can explain the excess, and their possible relations with interesting UV constructions, provides strong theoretical motivation for a new physics interpretation of the KOTO data."

In this letter, we investigate potential new physics explanations of the recently observed
excess of events at the KOTO experiment, which is searching for a rare decay of the Kaon.
We examine two new physics scenarios: the minimal extension of the Standard Model with a
new scalar that mixes with the SM Higgs (the so-called "Higgs Portal"), and a "hadrophilic
scalar mediator", which couples only to the up-type quarks. We find that both models can
explain the observed events, avoiding all current constraints in two different ways, which
provides strong motivation for new physics explanations of the events at KOTO.
