# Abstract.
abstract = "The scalar singlet model extends the Standard Model with the addition of a new gauge singlet scalar. We re-examine the limits on the new scalar from oblique parameter fits and from a global fit to precision electroweak observables and present analytic expressions for our results. For the case when the new scalar is much heavier than the weak scale, we map the model onto the dimension-six Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) and review the allowed parameter space from unitarity considerations and from the requirement that the electroweak minimum be stable. A global fit to precision electroweak data, along with LHC observables, is used to constrain the parameters of the high scale singlet model and we determine the numerical effects of performing the matching at both tree level and 1-loop."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary =  "We examine the importance of one-loop matching of the singlet onto the SM Effective Field Theory, quantifying the effects via a global fit to Higgs measurements at the LHC and Electroweak Precision observables."
