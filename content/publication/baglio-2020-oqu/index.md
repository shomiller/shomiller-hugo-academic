# Abstract.
abstract = "The production of ùëäH, ZH, WW and WZ pairs probes non-Standard-Model interactions of quarks, gauge bosons, and the Higgs boson. New effects can be parameterized in terms of an effective field theory (EFT) where the Lagrangian is expanded in terms of higher-dimension operators suppressed by increasing powers of a high scale Lambda. We examine the importance of including next-to-leading-order QCD corrections in global fits to the coefficients of the EFT. The numerical implications on the fits due to different approaches to enforcing the validity of the EFT are quantified. We pay particular attention to the dependence of the fits on the expansion in 1/Lambda^2 since the differences between results calculated at O(1/Lambda^2) and O(1/Lambda^4) may give insight into the possible significance of dimension-8 effects."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary = "We extend our analysis of NLO corrections in the SMEFT on $WW$ and $WZ$ to include the $WH$ and $ZH$ processes."
