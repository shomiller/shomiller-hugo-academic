I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow in the <a href=https://hetg.physics.harvard.edu>High Energy Theory Group</a> at Harvard University, working under Professor <a href=http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~mreece/>Matthew Reece</a> on various topics in High Energy Theory and Particle Phenomenology. 

Prior to joining the group at Harvard, I obtained my Ph.D. as part of the  <a href=http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu>C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics (YITP)</a> at Stony Brook University, working with Professor <a href=http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/~meade>Patrick Meade</a>. My dissertation was awarded the J. J. and Noriko Sakurai Dissertation Award in Theoretical Particle Physics in 2021. I also spent some time as a visitor at Brookhaven National Laboratory working with Sally Dawson as part of the DOE SCGSR (Graduate Student Research) Program. I did my undergraduate work at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign where I graduated in 2015 with a B.S. in Physics and a B.S. in Mathematics.
